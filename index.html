            <h2>What is organic design?</h2>
            <p>Organic design uses thousands of "agents" (imagine an ant in a colony) that make decisions based on
                simple rules. The product of these thousands of agents moving around interacting with each other and the
                environment is an organism. Imagine the body as a huge number of cells, none of which know they're in a
                body, but perform their specific function to keep us alive.</p>
            <p>We can use computers to simulate this process to create physical forms that we can then fabricate with
                tools like 3D printers or as instructions to build manually. Instead of needing to know exactly what we
                need upfront for a design for a chair or a house, the designer can define the environment, create agents
                with simple roles and then allow the design to unfold. It's a bit like handing over control of the
                process to the hive mind that then grows into the required form.</p>
            <p>There are lots of applications for this method of design. In this project I've used these principles to
                create sculptures and cityscapes to imagine what the future
                of the built environment might be in a world with 3D printed buildings, communications built into
                building materials and sensors to capture a wide range of data about the environment.</p>
            <p>With those I'm hoping to bring some of the feeling of nature into the built environment. Organic
                design uses self organising systems to finds optimal designs. It adapts to the environment it's is in
                the
                same way that plants and trees do. Because it mimics cellular growth it has a natural aesthetic as
                well. I think we're wired for nature because we can see the process of life within it like a tree
                shaped by the wind.</p>

            <h2>3 simple rules</h2>
            <p>The flocking of birds (called murmuration when starlings do it) is governed by 3 simple rules:
            <ol>
                <li>Cohesion: fly towards the middle of the group</li>
                <li>Alignment: fly in the same direction as neighbors</li>
                <li>Separation: keep a small distance away from neighbors</li>
            </ol>
            With just these, we get complex patterns and shapes and this is what I've used in my work. <strong>
None of these examples are manually created, they're all variants from the simulation that can produce an infinite number of different forms 
            </strong>

                <h2>Self-organising systems</h2>
                <p>I've been fascinated with swarms for some time. There's lots of names for this concept but a good one
                    is
                    emergence. Complex phenomena that emerge from many agents in a system interacting
                    without central control. They exist at the level of neurons in the brain, honey bees moving to a
                    new
                    hive and right up to social systems made up of people making choices like market economies.</p>
                <p>Cities are a great example. There are planning laws and schemes but our built environment and the way
                    we
                    move around the city is largely determined by individual choices. The shape of London and the
                    character
                    of its neighborhoods isn't determined by a master plan. It's grown over time through many iterations
                    and
                    the interaction of humans moving around, deciding where to live and shop and so on.</p>

                <h2>Responding to the environment</h2>
                <p>We can use organic design to respond to the conditions of the environment. In this work I've created
                    buildings and sculptures that respond to light and the presence of other objects. For light each
                    agent
                    in the system checks to see if it's in the sunlight or not and reacts accordingly, moving into a
                    position where it has a direct line of sight to the sun. They also scan the area for other buildings
                    and
                    either gravitate towards them or move away from them depending on the settings.</p>
                <p>Responsive design allows us to go further than this by using sensor data to collection information
                    about
                    how people are using a space to respond. When people use a space and it starts to get crowded,
                    agents
                    can be programmed with rules that cause them to move away from clusters of people, expanding the
                    space
                    in a way that feels natural. Likewise they could also grow new rooms when demand requires it or old
                    unused spaces could decay. With organic design these behaviours don't have to be specifically
                    programmed
                    in to predict every eventuality and outcome. The building-as-organism just needs a simple rule to
                    know
                    how each agent should respond to a local condition.</p>
